% \begin{block}{Abstract}
%   Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that affects 1 in 10
%   adults over 65 in the United States, is characterized by neuroinflammation,
%   neurofibrillary tangles, and aggregated amyloid-β plaques in the brain.
%   These key pathologies lead to debilitating symptoms including impaired
%   cognitive function and memory loss. Recent studies indicate a correlation
%   between the gut microbiota and AD, which may be due to mechanisms such as
%   increased inflammatory responses that aggravate neuroinflammation. The gut
%   microbiota is the aggregate of all microbial life resident in the
%   gastrointestinal tract. This bidirectional communication between gut
%   microbes and the brain is known as the gut microbiota-brain axis. By
%   identifying the microbial communities resident in the ileum of triple
%   transgenic mice modeling AD pathologies (3xTg-AD), we can understand
%   correlations between key microbial taxa and AD pathogenesis. In this
%   research, we evaluated the ileum microbiota and inflammatory responses of
%   triple transgenic AD mice compared to wild-type control mice. The ileum is
%   the most distal region of the small intestine and a known site for immune
%   modulation due to the presence of lymph nodules known as Peyer’s patches.
%   Analysis of ileum microbiota composition was performed by sequencing the V4
%   region of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbiome bioinformatics was performed using
%   QIIME 2. Inflammatory responses were quantified using reverse transcriptase
%   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) with targeted gene primers
%   and statistical analysis was performed using Prism. We expect to see mice
%   genetically predisposed to developing AD pathologies exhibit a decreased
%   species richness and altered composition of the ileum microbiome and
%   upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. These studies will provide a
%   critical link between the ileum microbiome, inflammation, and AD, and will
%   contribute to development of microbiota-based therapeutics for AD.

\begin{block}{Objective and Introduction}

    \textbf{Objective:} To correlate features of the microbial communities
    resident in the ileum of triple transgenic mice modeling AD pathologies
    (3xTg-AD) with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis.

    \textbf{Relevant Context:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item AD is a neurodegenerative disease that affects 1 in 10 adults over 65 in the United States
      \item The gut microbiota is the aggregate of all microbial life resident in the gastrointestinal tract.
      \item The ileum, the most distal region of the small intestine, is a known site for immune modulation
      \item Studies correlate gut microbiome characteristics and AD pathology, possibly facilitated by bidirectional communication between gut microbes and the brain along the 'gut-brain axis'
      \item AD is characterized by neuroinflammation, neurofibrillary tangles, and aggregated amyloid-β plaques in the brain.
      \item Mouse models of AD are pre-symptomatic at 8 weeks of age, have begun to exhibit AD pathologies at 24 weeks, and have advanced AD pathologies at 52 weeks.
      \item These pathologies may be influenced by inflammatory cytokines produced in the gut.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Hypothesis:}
    Mice genetically predisposed to developing AD pathologies will exhibit
    altered composition of the ileum microbiota and upregulation of
    proinflammatory cytokines. These shifts will be increasingly visible as
    disease pathologies develop.

    \begin{block}{Results}
      \textbf{qPCR results:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Humanized 3xTg-AD mice express significantly higher levels of Arg1 and Nos2 cytokines than age-matched Wild Type mice.
        \item Arg1 and Nos2 cytokines are expressed at significantly higher levels at 52 weeks than at 8 weeks.
      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{16S results:}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item At 8 and 24 weeks, we see no statistically significant alpha or beta diversity differences between 3xTg-AD and WT mouse microbiota.
      \item We see significant differences in microbiota compositions between 8 and 24-week samples, but our extraction scheme may confound these results*.
      \end{itemize}

    \begin{tcolorbox}
    [width=\textwidth, colframe=blue]
      * DNA was extracted from all 8-week samples in one batch, and all
      24-weeks samples in another. Though we find significant changes in
      alpha and beta diversity over time, it is impossible for us to rule out
      extraction bias as a confounding factor. Control samples extracted
      and sequenced alongside our ileum samples may allow us to control for 
      that effect and avoid re-sequencing for future publications.

  \begin{block}{Discussion}
    Though complete longitudinal data are not yet available, the results
    to date support our hypothesis: qPCR data indicates that our most
    significant results are at 52 weeks, as expected. Our final round of 16S
    sequencing has been delayed, but we look forward to its completion, and
    hope the trends we see in qPCR bear out.

      \item \textbf{52-Week Analysis} Investigation of correlations between qPCR findings and 52-week 16S data.
      \item \textbf{Immunohistochemistry} Quantification of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β plaques.
