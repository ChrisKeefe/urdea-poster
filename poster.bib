 abstract = {We have developed a unified format for phylogenetic placements, that is, mappings of environmental sequence data (e.g., short reads) into a phylogenetic tree. We are motivated to do so by the growing number of tools for computing and post-processing phylogenetic placements, and the lack of an established standard for storing them. The format is lightweight, versatile, extensible, and is based on the JSON format, which can be parsed by most modern programming languages. Our format is already implemented in several tools for computing and post-processing parsimony- and likelihood-based phylogenetic placements and has worked well in practice. We believe that establishing a standard format for analyzing read placements at this early stage will lead to a more efficient development of powerful and portable post-analysis tools for the growing applications of phylogenetic placement.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by distinct behavioral and cognitive deficits that differ from those observed in normal aging. Transgenic models of AD are a promising tool in understanding the underlying mechanisms and cause of disease. The triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) is the only model to exhibit both Aβ and tau pathology that is characteristic of the human form. The present study characterized the performance of 3xTg-AD mice on several tasks measuring behavioral and cognitive ability. Aged 3xTg-AD females exhibited a higher level of fear and anxiety demonstrated by increased restlessness, startle responses, and freezing behaviors. No differences were observed in muscle strength and visuo-motor coordination. Understanding the behavioral manifestations that occur in this model of AD may aid in the early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of AD symptomology.}

	abstract = {The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is poorly understood. Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, has long been associated with bacterial infections and inflammation-causing immunosenescence. Recent studies examining the intestinal microbiota of AD patients revealed that their microbiome differs from that of subjects without dementia. In this work, we prospectively enrolled 108 nursing home elders and followed each for up to 5 months, collecting longitudinal stool samples from which we performed metagenomic sequencing and in vitro T84 intestinal epithelial cell functional assays for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, a critical mediator of intestinal homeostasis. Our analysis identified clinical parameters as well as numerous microbial taxa and functional genes that act as predictors of AD dementia in comparison to elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We further demonstrate that stool samples from elders with AD can induce lower P-gp expression levels in vitro those samples from elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We also paired functional studies with machine learning approaches to identify bacterial species differentiating the microbiome of AD elders from that of elders without dementia, which in turn are accurate predictors of the loss of dysregulation of the P-gp pathway. We observed that the microbiome of AD elders shows a lower proportion and prevalence of bacteria with the potential to synthesize butyrate, as well as higher abundances of taxa that are known to cause proinflammatory states. Therefore, a potential nexus between the intestinal microbiome and AD is the modulation of intestinal homeostasis by increases in inflammatory, and decreases in anti-inflammatory, microbial metabolism.IMPORTANCE Studies of the intestinal microbiome and AD have demonstrated associations with microbiome composition at the genus level among matched cohorts. We move this body of literature forward by more deeply investigating microbiome composition via metagenomics and by comparing AD patients against those without dementia and with other dementia types. We also exploit machine learning approaches that combine both metagenomic and clinical data. Finally, our functional studies using stool samples from elders demonstrate how the c microbiome of AD elders can affect intestinal health via dysregulation of the P-glycoprotein pathway. P-glycoprotein dysregulation contributes directly to inflammatory disorders of the intestine. Since AD has been long thought to be linked to chronic bacterial infections as a possible etiology, our findings therefore fill a gap in knowledge in the field of AD research by identifying a nexus between the microbiome, loss of intestinal homeostasis, and inflammation that may underlie this neurodegenerative disorder.},

abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report examines the use of brief cognitive assessments by primary care physicians as a tool for improving early detection of dementia. An estimated 5.8 million Americans have Alzheimer's dementia. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States may grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. In 2017, official death certificates recorded 121,404 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among Americans age ≥65 years. Between 2000 and 2017, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased 145%. In 2018, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.5 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at nearly $234 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with Alzheimer's or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments in 2019 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with dementia are estimated to be $290 billion. Early detection of Alzheimer's offers numerous medical, emotional and financial benefits—benefits that accrue to affected individuals and their families as well as to society at large. Alzheimer's Association surveys regarding brief cognitive assessments for detection of dementia found that while a large majority of seniors and primary care physicians say the assessments are important, only half of seniors have received an assessment, and only 16 percent of seniors receive regular cognitive assessments. Many educational opportunities exist to facilitate increased use of brief cognitive assessments in the primary care setting.}
