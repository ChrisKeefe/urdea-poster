## Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that affects 1 in 10 adults over 65 in the United States, is characterized by neuroinflammation, neurofibrillary tangles, and aggregated amyloid-β plaques in the brain. These key pathologies lead to debilitating symptoms including impaired cognitive function and memory loss. Recent studies indicate a correlation between the gut microbiota and AD, The gut microbiota is the aggregate of all microbial life resident in the gastrointestinal tract. This bidirectional communication between gut microbes and the brain is known as the gut microbiota-brain axis. By identifying the microbial communities resident in the ileum of triple transgenic mice modeling AD pathologies (3xTg-AD), we can understand correlations between key microbial taxa and AD pathogenesis. In this research, we evaluated the ileum microbiota and inflammatory responses of triple transgenic AD mice compared to wild-type control mice. The ileum is the most distal region of the small intestine and a known site for immune modulation due to the presence of lymph nodules known as Peyer’s patches. 

Analysis of ileum microbiota  composition was performed by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbiome bioinformatics was performed using QIIME 2. Inflammatory responses were quantified using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) with targeted gene primers and statistical analysis was performed using Prism. 

We expect to see mice genetically predisposed to developing AD pathologies exhibit a decreased species richness and altered composition of the ileum microbiome and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. These studies will provide a critical link between the ileum microbiome, inflammation, and AD, and will contribute to development of microbiota-based therapeutics for AD.
